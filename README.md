# Portfolio

This is the first of many websites I have constructed! This is a place to display my future work/projects to showcase to future employers. 

I began by creating an HTML file to construct the 'skeleton' of the website, I then added CSS to style elements and created media queries for a responsive layout when the window is resized. 
I built this project to showcase future projects to employers and am motivated by the career opportunities that could come out of this portfolio. 
Since I did not have one space to display projects, this solves that problem by creating an inclusive area for employers to see my work. 
I learned how to build a website from scratch and the intricacies of HTML/CSS. 


## Installation

Users can follow this link to access the portfolio: https://sydneyloggins.github.io/Portfolio/

## Usage
The navigation bar in the top right will bring users to the implied section of the portfolio. Each image under "work" section will link the user to the project (since I am brand new to web development, I created a rough HTML file to link instead of an actual project).
The links under the "contact me" section will lead the user to the corresponding contact info.
